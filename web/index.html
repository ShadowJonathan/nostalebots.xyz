      <h1 class="center">No More Stale Bots!</h1>
      <p>
        On GitHub, there has been an increasing trend of using "Staleness
        detector bots" that will auto-close issues that have had no activity for
        X amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In concept, this may sound fine, but the effects this has, and how it
        poisons the core principles of Open Source, have been damaging and
        eroding projects for a long time, often unknowingly.
      </p>

      <h2>Before Triage</h2>
      <p>
        Usually, issues on GitHub are triaged, which means an initial assessment
        of the problem is done, project areas are labelled, severity, priority,
        or additional concerns such as whether or not the issue was already
        duplicated elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        This initial triage may take a few weeks, but are often the first step
        in user-submitted issues, where it then comes in scope of workflows.
      </p>
      <h3>How do Stale Bots fit into this?</h3>
      <p>
        Often, stale bots are setup without any awareness of this triage
        process, and so issues "slip through the cracks", where a user-submitted
        issue then gets ignored for 2 weeks, a month, or however long the
        "staleness" period lasts, gets marked as stale, and then very quickly
        auto-closed without any developer being aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, this is not healthy for the project, as issues can be brought
        up again and again, ignored every time, and cause the project to
        languish as users see that their complaints or issues are not heard.
      </p>

      <h2>After Triage</h2>

      <p>
        The above pertains projects that have any triage process at all, but
        often, there's no such process, or the issues are expected to be
        labelled on-demand, when developers see them and sort them as "not in my
        wheelhouse, its in theirs".
      </p>

      <p>
        Even in this situation, the stale bot causes massive amounts of
        problems, because then the definition of "a good issue" shifts from "any
        issue (that is reproducible and documented)" to "any issue that has a
        lot of activity on it."
      </p>

      <p>
        On the developer side, issue activity can be a lot of noise, and often,
        exhaustion kicks in, then apathy, where the developer no longer wants to
        work on an issue that is being kept alive by +1s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, even after that, when the activity dies down (understandably, as a
        lot of people just subscribe to the issue and wait, not having anything
        useful to add to the conversation), the stale bot will see the issue as
        "stale", due to there being no activity, and only with the active
        lookout by some users, these issues are then "saved" by someone bumping
        the thread with "not stale", and continuing to need to do so for
        multiple months until a developer takes a look at it, or until their
        patience runs out, closing and hiding the issue at hand, having achieved
        nothing in the end.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <i>
            "Stalebots configured to close issues are a glorified footgun and we
            all know it, but what's worse, you're making everyone around you
            angry for firing that gun repeatedly and making everyone else spend
            time cleaning up after your gunshots (issues that shouldn't have
            been closed)."
          </i>
        </p>
        <span style="text-align: right; display: block">
          <small> - Someone on GitHub</small>
        </span>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Excuses</h2>
      <p>
        There are quite some common excuses as to why staleness bots are used,
        and here are some of them, and some counterarguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that, from all arguments I've heard for stale bots so far, I have
        not found any of them compelling enough to warrant the <i>need</i> for
        auto-closing stale bots. There is value to be had in stale bots that
        only label and never close, as that could facilitate a dev to check on
        issues that can be low-hanging fruit to reap or work on, but never to
        auto-close them after these periods.
      </p>

      <h3>
        "There are too many issues to work through, and the stale bot cuts the
        ones down that appear to have priority for users"
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a fallacy, and conflates multiple things together in ways that
        do not function.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, "user priority" is not measured in the activity on a thread.
        Usually, users just üëç the issue in question, or just subscribe, and
        move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The numbers for emojis are visible, and a sufficiently advanced stale
        bot could make sure that since X time ago, nobody has added any emoji,
        but i see no bot do such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subscriber numbers would be a similar story, but unfortunately there's
        no way to get the amount of subscribers for a particular issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, none of that matters, as this still conflates "user priority"
        with "user activity". Priority is very subjective, and is also something
        that the maintainers need to determine about a particular issue,
        weighing tons of different variables together. Sometimes, developers
        also create internal issues that then get reaped the same by the stale
        bot, these do not have "user priority" nor "user activity".
      </p>
      <p>
        As said above, even if an issue does attract interest, eventually this
        interest will dwindle, be it at the sight of inactivity from the devs,
        or because the noise has caused people to turn away, or by the simple
        recognition that users in the thread have already said enough about the
        issue at hand, and nothing more needs to be said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, after these periods, the stale bot will still reap the issue, and
        so an issue with 800 thumbs up and 150 comments will be closed without
        resolution. Is this a proper way to handle Open Source Software?
      </p>

      <h3>"We have too many issues, this will cut down on them"</h3>
      <p>First off, why is that necessary?</p>
      <p>Seriously, <b>WHY?</b></p>
      <p>
        Why do you need to cut down on issue count? Is this a KPI your company
        has instigated? Do you know of the phrase
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law"
          >"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
          measure."?</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Even more so, what are you actually trying to achieve here? A low issue
        count does not mean that the project is robust and/or reliable. The rust
        project currently has near
        <a
          href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc"
          >9.000 issues</a
        >, does that mean that the project is unreliable and broken?
      </p>
      <p>
        What's more, issues aren't processed, they are discarded, they are not
        regarded and/or triaged in most cases, which <i>is</i> a way your
        project can become unreliable and broken, as you blind your developers
        to potential or ongoing issues.
      </p>

      <h3>
        "Issues can pile up because users file a lot of them, and their problems
        are fixed with new releases"
      </h3>
      <p>Really, have you checked? <i>Do</i> you check that? You do not.</p>
      <p>
        What's more, this sounds like an issue with triage, where not much
        resources are left for user triage, deduplication, routing, and proper
        community management, to handle these issues in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also normalizes the idea of not having to answer or look at
        potentially-problematic issues, as "They'll go away, anyway".
      </p>
      <p>
        In this regard, labelling but not closing issues could give a dedicated
        person the places to look for when post-triaging issues that were filed
        ages ago, and routing the user to the relevant fix, giving them closure,
        and building community trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        But closing issues doesn't do that, it silences their voices, and on
        their end, the developers never answer their question, which gives low
        confidence in the project overall.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I will acknowledge that triaging and managing issues is an
        energy-consuming job, and a mostly-thankless one, but it is an important
        one nonetheless. Ignoring issues is better than hiding them, as the
        stale bot is then essentially a cold face telling the users that you
        <i>definitely</i> do not care about their problems.
      </p>

      <h3>
        "Why is not closing an issue, while still marking stale, all of the
        sudden okay?"
      </h3>
      <p>
        It doesn't close issues, it just tags them. This makes it possible for
        developers to become aware of them like "hey, it's been a while since
        this issue was touched, it might need an update", which can have
        interesting dynamics with the issue lifecycle policy that developers
        have then and there.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this dynamic is not available when the issue simply disappears,
        gets closed, which removes it from the lifecycle altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply said, it gives issues a chance to survive, and to participate in
        the ecosystem of todo issues. How'd you like it if people stopped
        thinking about the riemann hypothesis because nobody has touched it in 2
        weeks? Or ignore your tax returns because you took too long to respond
        to their inquiry? Or for a GP to disregard your request because it took
        too long for them to come around and answer it?
      </p>
      <p>
        These are not exactly proper comparisons, but the emotional response
        they evoke certainly is, and the illogicality/"bullshittery" of it
        certainly looks and feels the same.
