![NoStaleBots Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/No_Stale_Bot_Here-blue?logo=probot&logoColor=silver&link=https%3A%2F%2Fnostalebots.xyz%2F)


A website explaining some ways auto-closing stale bots can be harmful, and how they don't fit in the modern open source project workflow.

This is a (Perpetual) Work In Progress, if you have any suggestion on wording, pages, sections, or else, please file an issue :)

Text is added/edited under [src/index.md](src/index.md), projects are added under [src/_data/projects.yaml](src/_data/projects.yaml).

This site uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).

(You can add the badge to your repo with this bit of markdown:)
